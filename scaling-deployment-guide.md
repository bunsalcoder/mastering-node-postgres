# Scaling and Deployment

## 1. Database Sharding

### What is Sharding?
Sharding is the process of splitting a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is an independent database that contains a subset of the data.

### Types of Sharding
- **Range-Based Sharding**: Distributes data based on a defined range (e.g., users A-M in one shard, N-Z in another).
- **Hash-Based Sharding**: Uses a hash function to evenly distribute data across shards.
- **Geo-Based Sharding**: Distributes data based on geographical regions.

### Implementing Sharding in PostgreSQL
Use **Citus** (PostgreSQL extension) for distributed sharding:
```sql
-- Enable Citus extension
CREATE EXTENSION citus;

-- Create distributed table
SELECT create_distributed_table('users', 'id');
```

## 2. Replication

### Why Use Replication?
Replication improves fault tolerance and read performance by maintaining copies of the database across multiple servers.

### Setting Up PostgreSQL Replication
1. **Configure Primary Server** (PostgreSQL `postgresql.conf`):
```conf
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 3
wal_keep_size = 64MB
```

2. **Set Up a Standby Server**:
```sh
pg_basebackup -h primary_host -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -P -U replication -R
```

3. **Start the Standby Server**:
```sh
pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### Failover with Patroni
Patroni automates PostgreSQL failover:
```sh
pip install patroni
patroni /etc/patroni.yml
```

## 3. Containerization with Docker

### Why Use Docker?
Docker allows packaging applications and databases into portable containers, making deployments consistent across environments.

### Dockerizing a Node.js and PostgreSQL Application
1. **Create a `Dockerfile` for Node.js**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
EXPOSE 3000
```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL**:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

3. **Run the Containers**:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## 4. CI/CD Pipelines

### Why Use CI/CD?
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates testing and deployment to improve reliability and efficiency.

### Setting Up a GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**:
```yaml
name: Deploy Application
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

2. **Automating Deployment with Docker**:
```yaml
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Server
        run: |
          ssh user@server 'docker pull myrepo/myapp:latest && docker-compose up -d'
```

### Alternative CI/CD Tools
- **Jenkins**: Customizable CI/CD automation tool.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Integrated with GitLab repositories.
- **CircleCI**: Cloud-based CI/CD automation.

By implementing sharding, replication, containerization, and CI/CD, you can scale and deploy your applications efficiently for high availability and performance.
